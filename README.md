# Biomedical-Modeling-and-Simulation
You can find the Biomedical Simulations and Models that I've learned and practiced during my Biomedical Engineering degree. I've spent a lot of times on simulations and the information complexity in the internet made it harder. I'm sharing it so you don't waste your time as much as I did.
